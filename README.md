D-Stress is a Progressive Web App I created for a project for the honors program at my university. It is meant to be a simple, quick stress reliever. This app is only meant to be used for 1-3 minutes at a time. It is meant to be used on mobile as an app downloaded to the homescreen, but it works well in PC web browsers as well.
